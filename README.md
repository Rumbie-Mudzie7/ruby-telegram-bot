# RUBY-TELEGRAM-BOT

![Page screenshot](./images/telegram-bot-screenshot.png)

The Telegram Bot is a friendly bot, built using the Ruby best practices and implementing Object Oriented Programming principles.

The program creates and initializes a Telegram bot. The program then retrieves the first name of the account holder for a friendly greeting and advises them to use  /start to start the bot,  /stop to end the bot, /inspire to get a inspirational quote everytime you request for it or /joke to get a joke everytime it is requested.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

Prerequisites - Ruby, RubyGems and Telegram bot
Make sure you have the latest version of Ruby installed for your operating system from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Check using using 'ruby -v' on the command line or terminal to make sure it is at least version 2.1 and above.

Download and install latest RubyGems from https://rubygems.org/pages/download and then confirm it is updated by using 'gem update --system' or 'gem install rubygems-update' and 'update_rubygems' on the command line or terminal.

Install Telegram on your device from https://telegram.org/ and make sure you have a working telegram account. 

With ruby installed and an account created, we also need to obtain a code from telegram called an A.P.I token. To do this we need the help of the bot father. Just type the command /new bot, and follow the instructions of the bot father.
